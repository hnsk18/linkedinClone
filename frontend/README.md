# LinkUp - Frontend (React + Vite)

This folder contains a minimal React frontend scaffold for the LinkUp project. It provides a responsive `Login` page implemented in JSX and a small Vite-based project structure.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Files created

- `package.json` — project manifest
- `index.html` — Vite entry
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry file
- `src/App.jsx` — app root rendering `Login`
- `src/components/Login.jsx` — JSX login component
- `src/styles/login.css` — styles for the login page

Next steps

- Wire the `Login` component to your Spring Boot authentication API (use `fetch` or `axios`).
- Add routing, other pages (signup, feed, profile), and state management as needed.

If you want, I can now:
- Add signup page and routing
- Integrate form with a sample backend API
- Convert to TypeScript

Tell me which next step you'd like me to implement.
